# Autofocosing routines.
#
# You will need: scipy matplotlib sextractor
# This should work on Debian/Ubuntu:
# sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-scipy python-pyfits sextractor
#
# If you would like to see sextractor results, get DS9 and pyds9:
#
# http://hea-www.harvard.edu/saord/ds9/
#
# Please be aware that current sextractor Ubuntu packages does not work
# properly. The best workaround is to install package, and the overwrite
# sextractor binary with one compiled from sources (so you will have access
# to sextractor configuration files, which program assumes).
#
# Alternatively, use SEP package (pip install sep; http://sep.readthedocs.org).
