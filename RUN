RTS 2 - how to start it
=======================

OK, so you read INSTALL, go through all the steps, and have nice
rts2-xxxx binaries sitting in your /usr/local/bin and waiting to be executed.

First some hints:

- don't panic!
- if something does not work, write to petr@kubanek.net. If he does not
  respond, chances are that the mail ended in SPAM filter and was never read.
  You will find contact details (including phone, skype,..) on
  http://petr.kubanek.net, so try to contact him using a more interactive
  communication.

Creating and populating /etc/rts2 directory
===========================================

First of all, you need to create and populate /etc/rts2 directory. This
directory holds RTS2 configuration files. At beginning. As root. issue
following commands:

root@host:$ cd rts2
root@host:rts2$ ./rts2-init

Now you need to edit /etc/rts2/rts2.ini and provide values for your
installation (they are marked with xxxx, so just search for that and replace
its occurences).

We will come to pupulating /etc/rts2 with other files needed for devices etc.
later.

Creating database
=================

You can skip this part if you want RTS2 without database. But if you run
astronomical observatory, you will not be able to do any reasonable work
without it. So:

- create/add user to allowed database users. On Debian, after you install postgresql-server:

root@host:$ su postgres             # you must be root. Do sudo bash on Ubuntu and similar systems.
root@host:$ createuser <username>   # where you replace username with your username

Grant rights to create db and superuser (when asked, press y). Please consult
Postgresql manual for details. Or write me.

For Ubuntu 16.04 you must execute the following commands:

user@host:$ sudo -i -u postgres		# login to 'postgres' user
postgres@host:$ createuser --interactive user	# change 'user' with your Ubuntu user name.
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
postgres@host:$ exit # Returns to Ubuntu user.

- setup RTS2 database. Usually it is called stars, but you are free to create
  your own. Just choose other name.

user@host:$ createdb stars  # you must be user which have granted database access
user@host:$ cd rts2/src/sql
user@host:$ ./rts2-builddb stars

If you want planets and Landolt fields, answer the questions with y. If you
want to run RTS2 with dummy devices as configured in conf/devices file, run:

user@host:$ cd rts2/src/sql/data
user@host:$ psql stars < dummy.sql

Try the database with:

user@host:$ rts2-targetinfo 1

1 is dark frame target. It shoudl print something like:
    1 d         nan         nan +00:00 nan          nan         nan transiting Dark frames
       C0:'D 0'
        |-- expected light time: 0 # images 1
        \-- expected duration: 0
     Expected maximal script duration: 0

If it does not print that out, there is something wrong. Please investigate it,
try to fix it, or write me.

Creating targets of your choice
===============================

Probably the best way how to create a target is using rts2-newtarget. There is
a sample session:

user@host:$ rts2-newtarget 
Default values are written at []..
Target name, RA&DEC or anything else []: M31
Target name, RA&DEC or anything else: M31
2008-05-15T12:49:14.698 app 2 Cannot find value 'epoch_id' in section 'observatory'.
2008-05-15T12:49:14.699 app 1 Cannot find section 'newtarget'.
Simbad response for 'M31':

(You press enter when asked for ID, but enter name, as you don't like 2C 56 the
system is offering from SIMBAD).

After creating your targets, run:

usrr@host: rts2-seltest
ID                  20
SEL_ID              20
NAME                MAblank1

RA                  01:00:00.000
DEC                 +000 07 00.00

Please consult man rts2-target for details how to edit the target (most
probably you will like to enable it and raise its priority -
rts2-target -e -p 200 <tar_id> will do that). See man rts2-targetinfo for
details how to print target informations (including way how to produce nice
graphs depicting target height etc..).

Running and testing RTS2
========================

So you want to start the beast up? You will need to (as root user):

root@host:rts2$ cp rts2.initd /etc/init.d/rts2

Before you will run to:

root@host:rts2$ cp conf/services conf/devices conf/centrald conf/sd /etc/rts2

and editing /etc/rts2/devices (please see man rts2.devices for details what to
enter), so you will be able to do start RTS2 with:

root@host:rts2$ /etc/init.d/rts2 start

you might be interested in starting the thing manually. Do:

root@host: rts2-centrald -i

if it exits, you have a problem. If not, on other x-term window/terminal/console, do:

user@host: rts2-mon

It should show rts2-mon screen. Suppose you have LX200 connected to /dev/ttyS1, do:

root@host: rts2-teld-lx200 -f /dev/ttyS1 -i

If that does not exists with an error message, you should then see LX200 as T0
device in rts2-mon (run it in other x-term/..). The try to:

press key down to get to T0
the display on right changes to display telescope informations
write:
park
and press enter

Telescope shall move to parking position

write:
move 180 0
and press enter

If that coordinate is above horizon, telescope should move there. Please change
coordinates (RA DEC) according to your location, the best is to try some object
which is circumpolar (DEC > 90 - latitude for northern hemisphere, DEC < -90 -
latitude on southern hemisphere).

First in move command is RA (in degrees, <0,360> range), second is DEC (in
degrees, <-90,+90> range).

Now move to camera, Following is demonstration with dummy, please change dummy
string on following line to name of your camera driver.

root@host:$ rts2-camd-dummy -i

If you have FLI camera, you will run:

root@host:$ rts2-camd-fli -i

Then run from second Xterminal window:

root@host:$ rts2-xfocusc -d C0 -e 2

to get some images. If you reach till that point, running services shall be
quite easy for you.
