RTS2.SCRIPT(5)
==============

NAME
----
rts2.script - scripting for Remote Telescope System, 2nd Version

ABOUT
-----

Scripting is used to command various devices, which can be found
in RTS2 setup.

Script can contain block, enclosed in curved brackets ({}).  This
block ussually comes after 'for', 'if' and similar commands.

COMMANDS
--------

Commands are separated by an arbitrary number of spaces.  Here in
this description we use parameters enclosed in {curved brackets},
and afterwards explanation of their meaning is given in text.
Numerical values are entered in standard decimal notation.

cmd {command}[({arg{,arg2..}})]::
    Execute arbitrary command on the device. Command parameters
    can be specified in round bracket, separated with comma,
    without any space between command and ending bracket.

exe {executable}::
    Execute external script. The script communicates with executor
    through standard input and outputs - both normal and error
    output. For documentation of the protocol, as well as
    available Python class for handling of this communication,
    please see bellow. The executable may be either a filename or a
    quoted string containing filename and command-line parameters to
    be passed to it.

SEQUENCE {filter} {repeat} {exposure_time}::
    Performs exposure sequence. First set a filter, described as
    parameter. Then repeat *repeat* times execution of exposures
    with duration *exposure_time* seconds.

E {exposure_time}::
    Takes light exposure. Exposure time is specified
    in seconds.

D {exposure_time}::
    Takes dark frame, useful for calibration. Exposure time is
    specified in seconds.

I {exposure_time}::
    Takes an image, without changing shutter position. If the
    observer wish to have certain shutter position, SHUTTER=
    command must be used before I command. Exposure time is
    specified in seconds.

{value name}operation{new value}

    Perform value change of the specified value. *value name* is
    name of the value, *new value* is new value, either as string,
    or number in decimal notation. *operation* can be one of the
    following:

    * = Set new value. It works with all types of variables.

    * += Increase value. Works only with numeric values.

    * -= Decrease value. Works only with numeric values.

    Please see EXAMPLES section for sample scripts, which might
    clear how this command operates better than the description.

    Value name, operation and new value must be written without
    space. This is invalid: focpos +=10, focpos+= 10. This is
    valid: focpos+=10.

    Variables which have more the one component (telescope axes and
    offsets,..) must be coma "," separated and enclosed in round
    brackets "(", ")". This is valid syntax for increase of the
    telescope offset by 10 degrees in RA and 5 degrees in DEC:

    * T0.OFFS+=(10,5)

{device name}.!{value name}operation{new value}::
    Performs value operation only when camera is exposing. Useful
    to start an operation synchronously with camera exposure. For
    example, the following script:

    * TX.DRATE=(0.001,0.02) TX.DON=off for 10 { TX.!DON=on E 30 TX.DON=off sleep 5 }

    will set differential tracking rate, but does not apply it. It
    will apply differential tracking only when starting exposure,
    and reset it after exposure is done.  Note that TX represents
    any telescope device.

C {ra_diff} {dec_diff}::
    Offsets mount position before next exposure by {ra_diff} and
    {dec_diff}. Wait until no exposure is going on, then perform
    move, then continue exposing. Please note, that telescope
    which should change must by specified with . notation - so if
    your telescope is called T0, you must write T0.C {ra_diff}
    {dec_diff}

    {ra_diff} and {dec_diff} are in degrees.

hex {ra_diff} {dec_diff} [block]::
    Offsets mount position in hex pattern after finishing [block]
    and execute [block] again. This will produce images which are
    aligned on hexagonal path.

    {ra_diff} and {dec_diff} are in degrees.

fxf {ra_diff} {dec_diff} [block]::
    Change mount position in 5x5 rectangular pattern after
    finishing [block] and execute [block] again. This will produce
    images, which are aligned on rectangular path.

    {ra_diff} and {dec_diff} are in degrees.

BIN {binning}::
    Change both vertical and horizontal binning. Will be
    dropped in favour of value (*binning*) operation.

BOX {x} {y} {width} {heigh}::
    Readout only area of the chip, specified by pixel coordinates
    of upper left corner (x and y) and by area width and height.

CENTER {width} {height}::
    Readout center of the chip of provided width and height (in
    pixels).

W::
    Generic wait for any signal.

A {precision} {exposure_time}::
    Takes an image of {exposure_time}, tries astrometry, waits for
    a result. If the image is not within {precision} in degrees
    from a target position, then the procedure is repeated.  It
    will continue and it will take multiple images, as long as
    precision of the last image is at least twice better than
    previous image - e.g. if o1 is offset of the last image, and
    o0 is offset of previous one, o1 < o0 / 2.

Aw::
    Wait until A command on other camera is finished. If there is
    no running script with A command on any other device, it will
    continue with the next command.

P {filter} {exposure} {count}::
    Do measurements using photometer. {filter} is filter number
    (integer), {exposure} is exposure time in seconds (float
    number), and {count} is integer specifying how many
    measurements will be taken.

PS {radius} {speed}::
    Do cross-shaped search of maxima on photometer. {radius}
    specifies size of the arms in degrees, which will be searched,
    and speed specifies speed which will be used.

block_waitsig {signal}::
    Execute next block only if given signal arrives.

ifacq [block] [else [block]]::
    Start given commands only if acquisition of target ended
    sucessfully.

for {repeat_number} [block]::
    Execute commands in block for {repeat_number} times.

while {condition} {max_repeat} [block]::
    Execute block while condition evaluation is non-zero and number of
    repeats is smaller then max_repeat.

do {max_repeat} [block] while {condition}::
    Execute block while condition evaluation is non-zero and
    number of repeats is smaller then max_repeat. First test of
    condition occurs after first loop.

once [block]::
    Execute block only when the target script is executed for the
    first time. This command is ideal for executing focusing runs
    before the first science image.

    This command is usefull only for scripts executed from the
    linkman:rts2-executor[7].

    The block is run as without *once* command, when executed from
    the other tools capable of script execution.

waitfor {variable} {value} {range}::
    This command will wait for numeric {variable} to reach {value} with {range} margin.

sleep {seconds}::
    This command will pause execution of script for given number
    of seconds.

wait_idle::
    Waits for device to enter idle state.

SS {signal}::
    Sends given signal. Other scripts can wait for signal with
    SW command. Signal is integer number, which should be
    unique in script.

SW {signal}::
    Wait for a signal. Execution of the script is paused until
    the signal with given number ({}) is send.

tardisable::
    Disable target. In consectutive selector runs, it will not be considered
    for selection. Target can be re-enabled by linkman:rts2-target[1] command executed
    with -e option.

tempdisable {delay}::
    Temporaly disable target for delay seconds. Delay can be specified using
    delay string - e.g. h for hours, w for weeks. So to temporary delay target
    for 1 week, 2 days and 3 hours, the delay will be 1w2d3h. If next selector
    run hapened earlier then delay time from now, target will not be considered
    for observing. Target temporary disable is stored in NEXT_OBSERVABLE target
    parameter, which can be reseted by linkman:rts2-target[1] command executed
    with -o option.

tarboost {seconds} {bonus}::
    Temporary boost of target for {seconds}. It changes value of
    TARGET BONUS and TARGET BONUS TIME fields. Those fields
    can be changed by linkman:rts2-target[1] command executed with -b
    and -t options.

loopdisable::
    Disable looping of current obbservation. After the observation end, auto_loop
    variable in executor will be re-set to default_auto_loop value.

Communication with executable
-----------------------------
    If you use *exe* command in scripting, the script should communicate with
    RTS2 through standart input and outputs. The protocol is simple, text
    oriented, with lines ending with \n (end of line).  It is possible to write
    observing script using shell echo and read commands, as is demonstrated in
    example bellow. But for higher interaction, some higher language is
    prefered - based on user preferences, any of Python, PHP, Perl, TCL or
    other language capable to read and write to file descriptor will work.

exposure::
    Start exposure on the camera. Current exposure length setting and
    others current settings will be used.

    When exposure is finished, controlling script receives notification
    on standard input with *exposure_end* string.

    When the image is written to disk, controlling script receives image name
    on standard input, preceeded by *image* string. Script is responsible to
    specify treatment of the image - it might be copied, renamed or moved to
    some system locations. Please see bellow for an example. *If the script
    does not specify what will done with the image, the image will be deleted
    when script ends.*

exposure_wfn {pattern}::
    Allow user to provide filename for the next exposure(s). Works similarly to
    exposure command, with the exception that the file is not accesible after
    exposure is finished. Pattern, the only argument, is the RTS2 expand
    pattern for new filename.  *Script does not have to specify what should be
    done with the image in order to keep it on the disk after the script
    finish.*

exposure_overwrite {pattern}::
    Similar to *exposure_wfn*, but overwites existing file if pattern expand to
    an existing file.

progress {start} {expected end}::
    Report script progress. Script start and end times (in ctime, e.g.  seconds
    from 1-1-1970) are the only allowed arguments. Expected end should be in
    future, start should be some time ago.

    Issuing such command will update script_end and script_start variables.
    Maximal/minimal times of all running scripts are used for end/start times
    progress of the scripting device state.

rename {image name} {expression}::
    Renames image to given by an expression. Updates image record in database. Please see
    linkman:rts2.ini[5] for details of the expression. Bellow is an example,
    which start exposure, waits for image and rename image to given location.
    Returns new image name.
```
echo exposure
read exposure_end # is notified of exposure end
read image imagename  # $image will hold "image" string
echo rename $imagename /foo/bar/%f  # renames acquired image to /foo/bar/{standard image pattern}
read new_name # reads new image name to $new_name
```

move {image name} {expression}::
    Moves image to given path, delete it from the database. Please see rename
    command for an example. Returns new image name.

copy {image name} {expression}::
    Copy image to path given by an expression. Please see linkman:rts2.ini[5]
    for details of the expression. See rename command for an example.  Returns
    new image name.

process {image name}::
    Queue image to standard processing in linkman:rts2-imgproc[1].

flat {image name}::
    Move given image to sky flat destination, configured in
    linkman:rts2.ini[5].  Returns new image name.

dark {image name}::
    Move given image to raw dark destination, configured in
    linkman:rts2.ini[5].  Returns new image name.

archive {image name}::
    Move given image to raw dark destination, configured in linkman:rts2.ini[5]
    Returns new image name.

trash {image name}::
    Move given image to trash destination, configured in linkman:rts2.ini[5].
    Returns new image name.

V {device} {value name} {operator} {operand1 [operand2..]}::
    Change value of variable of given device. Operand can be any of =, +=
    or -=. If value have multiple components (e.g. telescope RA DEC
    offsets, or camera readout area), you must separated components with
    space.  Examples:
``` bash
echo V W0 filter += 1 # increases filter of device W0 by one
echo V T0 WOFFS = 0.01 0.01 # set WOFFS of device T0 to 0.01 in RA and DEC
echo V C1 WINDOW = 0 0 10 10 # set C1 WINDOW (readout area). C1 will read only upper left square with size of 10 pixels
```

VT {device_type} {value name} {operator} {operand1 [operand2..]}::
    Changes value of variable of devices of given type. Operand can be any of
    =, += or -=. If value have multiple components (e.g. telescope RA DEC
    offsets, or camera readout area), you must separated components with space.
    Following strings are allowed for device_type:

    * TELESCOPE
    * CCD
    * DOME
    * WEATHER
    * PHOT
    * PLAN
    * FOCUS
    * CUPOLA
    * FW
    * SENSOR

    Examples:
``` bash
echo VT FW filter += 1 # increases filter of all filter wheels by one
echo VT TELESCOPE WOFFS = 0.01 0.01 # set WOFFS of all telescopes to 0.01 in RA and DEC
echo VT CCD WINDOW = 0 0 10 10 # set all CCDs WINDOW (readout area).
```

set_own {value name} {new value}
    Change own value. Particularly usefull for values created with
    *string* and similar commands.

value {value name} {operator} {operand1 [operand2..]}::
    Change value of variable of script device. This is shortcut to easily
    interact with device on which the script is run. It is otherwise similar to
    V command.

``` bash
echo value exposure += 1
echo value WINDOW = 0 0 10 10
```

device_by_type {device_type}::
    Retrieves name of the first device with given type. Device type is
    specified by strings listed in *VT* command.

target_disable::
    Disables target for autonomouse selection.

target_tempdisable {seconds}::
    Temporary disable target for a given number of seconds.

end_script::
    End target script. Ask controlling block to end whole script.

end_target::
    End target execution. Ends scripts of all cameras, and execute next target
    if there is some available.

stop_target::
    Stop target execution. Ends scripts of all cameras, and stop the executor.

wait_target_move::
    Wait for target movement command completion. When this command returns with
    0, system telescope daemon is guarantee to have proper target coordinates
    for the next target execution.

loopcount::
    Print current loopcount. It is 0 when target script is executed for the
    first time.

run_device::
    Return name of the device on which the script is running.

? {value name}::
    Retrieves value of variable from scripting device. The value of variable is
    printed on standard output. If an erorr occured, string ERR is printed. See
    *G* command for an example - the only diference is that you should not
    specify device name.

G {device name} {value name}::
    Retrieves value of given variable from given device. The value of variable
    is printed on standard output. If an error occured, string ERR is printed.
    See bellow for an example:

```
G W0 filter
```
    If filter is set to number 5, 5 will be printed (followed by line feed) on
    standard output.

get_own {value name}::
    Retrieves own value. This is similar to *G* or *?*. It is handy to retrieve
    values created by *string* and other value cleation commands.

S {device name}
    Retrieves device state. Can retrieve centrald state if
    *device name* parameter is *"centrald"*.

waitidle {device name} {timeout}::
    Waits for *timeout* number of seconds for specified device to enter idle
    state. Return either 1 if device reached idle status, or 0 if the call
    timeouts.

    This function is equvivalent to calling *S* command, compare status and
    return 1 if device properly reached idle, 0 if it timeouts.
w
C {device name} {command..}::
    Executes an arbitary command on device. Please see device drivers source
    code for allowed commands - they are called from commandAuthorize call.

CT {device_type} {command..}::
    Executes an arbitary command on all device of given type. Please see
    *VT* command for list of allowed device type strings.

command {command..}::
    This call is similar to C (see above), except that the command is called on
    current scripting device.

tempentry {file/directory}::
    Add entry to list of files/directories, which will be deleted when script
    terminates. As security precaution, only files from /tmp directory can be
    specified in the path. File or directory must exists and must be writable
    at the time the command is issued. If the entry is removed by the script
    before it finish, no error is reported.

double {variable name} {variable description} {value} [{rts2 type}]::
double_w {variable name} {variable description} {value} [{rts2 type}]::
    Creates or update device double value. If variable with given name and
    double type is not in the device, it is created, populated with
    description, value type and value. If the variable is found and is of
    double type, its value is updated.

    The second form, *double_w*, creates writable variable. The first form
    creates variable which can be update only from a script. If the value
    already exists, it is not altered and a warning is issued. *_w* suffix is
    used with other variable commands described below to distinguish between
    constant, changeable only from the script, and writable variable, which can
    be changed by the user.

    This way, the script can permanently inform users about values it found.
    Assuming there is a *FWHM* measuring sctipt, echoing

```
double fwhm "[pixels] current FWHM, as meassured by foo bar script" 6.32
```

    will create *fwhm*, with given description and value equals to 6.32.

    The following constants can be specified as *type*:

    * DT_RA
    * DT_DEC
    * DT_DEGREES
    * DT_DEG_DIST
    * DT_PERCENTS
    * DT_ROTANG
    * DT_HEX
    * DT_BYTESIZE
    * DT_KMG
    * DT_INTERVAL
    * DT_ONOFF

time {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
time_w {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
    Creates or update device time value. Similar to *double* and *double_w* commands, described above.

integer {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
integer_w {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
    Creates or update device integer value. Similar to *double* and *double_w*
    commands, described above.

string {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
string_w {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
    Creates or update device string value. Similar to
    *double* and *double_w* commands, described above.

bool {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
bool_w {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
    Creates or update device boolean value. Similar to
    *double* and *double_w* commands, described above.

onoff {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
onoff_w {variable name} {variable description} {value}::
    Creates or update device boolean value with ON/OFF type. Similar to
    *bool* and *bool_w* commands, described above.

double_array {variable name} {variable description} {values..}::
double_array_w {variable name} {variable description} {values..}::
    Creates or update double array variable. If the array variable exists, its
    values are overwritten by specified values. Values to an existing array can
    be added with *double_array_add* command.

double_array_add {variable name} {values..}::
    Add new values to an existing double array variable.

stat {variable name} {variable description} {maxsize} {values..}::
stat_w {variable name} {variable description} {maxsize} {values..}::
    Creates or update double statistical variable. If the variable exists, its
    values are overwritten by specified values. Values to an existing variable can
    be added with *stat_add* command.

stat_add {variable name} {maxsize} {values..}::
    Add new values to an existing double statistical variable. The existing measurements are
    cropped so that the amount of measurements never exceed maxsize.

value_create {variable type} {variable_name} {variable description} {parameters or values..}::
    Creates a value of given type (double,integer,timevalue,bool,onoff,double_value,stat).
    Parameters are: writable, fits, or temporary, separated by whitespaces. The latter parameter
    makes the value script-temporary, so it will be deleted automatically when script is finished.
    This command may be sent to other device by prepending it with "C devicename".

value_delete {variable name}::
    Deletes the value with given name.
    This command may be sent to other device by prepending it with "C devicename".

value_add {variable name} {values..}::
    Add arbitrary number of new values to the existing variable, which should be either
    double array or double stat value.
    This command may be sent to other device by prepending it with "C devicename".

radec {ra} {dec}::
    Moves telescope to given equatorial (RA DEC) coordinates. Coordinates can
    be specified in HMS and DMS - see example bellow.

``` bash
echo radec 15 1  # moves to 1h RA, 1deg DEC
echo radec 1:2:3.4 -1:30 # moves to RA 1h 2m 3.4sec and DEC -1.5 deg
```

newobs {ra} {dec}
    Same as *radec*, but force system to log start of the new observation.

altaz {alt} {az}::
    Moves telescope to given horizontal (altitude and azimuth) coordinates.
    Tracking is still enabled after move finished. This command should be used
    when observations at some horizontal position are required from the script.

``` bash
echo altaz 20 30  # moves to 20 deg alttitude, 30 deg azimuth
```

newaltaz {alt} {az}::
    Same as *altaz*, but similarly to *newobs* starts new observation.

waitidle::
    Waits for telescope to become idle (tracking or hold).

log {level} {message}::
    Log something through RTS2 logging system. First letter of loglevel is
    significant, and its case does not matter. Log level can be E for errors, W
    for warnings, I for info, and D for debug messages.

## Variables
    Inside scripting, following syntax is used to access variables values.
    Please see examples at the end of this man page to gain better
    understanding of the topic.

    * .{variable_name} Access variable name from the current device - e.g. device on which
    script is run. Given that script is run on device C0, the *.average* is equal to *C0.average*.

    * {device_name}.{variable_name} Access variable from any device present in the system. If device or
    variable cannot be found, script is ended and target execution is
    blocked for the device whose script failed.

## Array indexing
    Arrays values can be indexed simirarly to Python. Numbers, : and , are
    allowed for array indexing. Array index must stars with [ and ends with ].
    Array indexes starts from 1 - e.g. first member has index 1, last has index
    equal to array size. Please see example section for some exampls.

Runing scripts
--------------
    Script can be run using linkman:rts2-scriptexec[5] command, or autonomously
    as part of execution of target through linkman:rts2-executor[5].

    Please be aware that scripts can be run only on camera or photometers
    devices. So for example, to move the telescope, one need to execute *in systems with C0 camera*.

```
rts2-scriptexec -d C0 -s 'T0.cmd hadec(-15,60)'
```

    Or even better, using TX to address any telescope:

```
rts2-scriptexec -d C0 -s 'TX.cmd hadec(-15,60)'
```

    To attach script for a target, use:

```
rts2-target -c C0 -s 'for 10 { E 10 filter+=1 }' 1002
```

EXAMPLES
--------
    Following script will call external script, which will hadle all
    communication. It will start exposure on camera, change filter and
    telescope offsets, and move image to given expand path. Then it asks for
    infotime variable, current sun azimuth and creates (or updates) test_double
    variable.

```
exe /home/user/bin/test.sh
```

    And this is the executable.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

for x in 1 2; do
	echo "value exposure = $x"
	echo "exposure"
	read exp_end
	echo "V W0 filter += 1"
	echo "V T0 WOFFS += 0.01 0.01"
	read x y
	# if the script does not specify what to do with the image, the image will be deleted!
	echo "rename $y %b/test/%f"
	read renamed
	echo "log E renamed $y to $renamed"
	# this will store image, no rename is needed
	echo "exposure_wfn %b/test/%f"
	read exp_end
	read x y
	echo "log I image %y"
	echo "? infotime"
	read x
	echo "G centrald sun_az"
	read y
	echo 'double test_double "[AU] double test value" 6.721'
	sleep 5
done
```

    The following script will take 10 5 seconds randomly ditthered observations (in range of 8 arcseconds):

```
for 10 { TX.OFFS=(rand(-8s,8s),rand(-8s,8s)) E 5 }
```

    The following script will run *exe .. E 10* part only once, when the target
    script is first observed. If target is changed, the *once* part will be run
    again.

```
once { exe .. E 10 } E 20 E 30
```

    Following script can be used for finding focus position. It moves focuser
    50 steps backwards. Then it starts a sequence of 10 5 seconds exposures,
    moving focuser position forward by 10 steps after each exposure.

```
focpos-=50 for 10 { E 5 focpos+=10 }
```

    This script test how various SPL_MODE affect resulting image. Sequence of
    1, 5 and 10 seconds exposures is taken, then SPL_MODE variable is increased
    by 1.

```
for 3 { E 1 E 5 E 10 SPL_MODE+=1 }
```

    Script bellow tests various gain and SPL_MODE settings.

```
for 3 { GAIN=0 for 10 { E 1 GAIN+=1 } SPL_MODE+=1 }

GAIN=20 for 3 { E 1 GAIN-=1 }

    Script bellow takes sequence of 10 and 20 seconds exposures in 10 filters,
    starting form filter named C.

```
filter=C for 10 { E 10 E 20 filter+=1 }
```

    Following scripts are equal, both take 5 20 seconds exposures in i filter.

```
filter=i for 5 { E 20 }

filter=i E 20 E 20 E 20 E 20 E 20

SEQUENCE i 5 20
```

    Sets all memmbers of boolean array to false.

```
    for 10 { E 10 S1.bools[1:2,2:]=0 }
```

    This is a simple example of the flat fielding script. It changes camera to
    readout a small window. Then it takes 1 seconds, wait for finish of
    readout, and check average value of the camera. If the average is bellow or
    equal to 2000, script carry on - switch back to full frame mode, and do 1
    seconds exposures until average value is above 2000.

```
WINDOW=(10,10,20,20) do 200 { E 1 wait_idle } while (.average > 2000) WINDOW=(-1,-1,-1,-1) do 200 { E 1 wait_idle } while (.average > 1000)
```

    Call command with arguments 5 and 1.

```
cmd apply(5,1)
```
