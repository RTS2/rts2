RTS2.TARGET(5)
==============

NAME
----
rts2.target - description of target types, how targets can be manipulated

ABOUT
-----

Target is entity describing goal of an observation. It has name, position
(which can be calculated - for example solar system bodies), priority,
constraints determining its visibility, and script which governs how it
will be observed.

### Target ID

Target ID is a number used internally in the database. Users are
encouraged to use targets names, which are far better to remember.

### Target observations constraints

Among one of the factors used during scheduling are observing constraints.
They are introduced in **constraints**
structure. Constraints can be specified for all targets, group of targets
(target types) and for a given target.  Constraints are specified in a
XML file, which should match schema from constraint.xsd file. The
structure of the constraint file is described in the following text.
Usually constraint is a set of intervals specifying allowed values for
given variable/observable. You can check value of most variables on target
information page, or looking from output of linkman:rts2-targetinfo[7]
-e command (executed with -e option).

There is an example **constraints**
sequence. This specifies that observations should be carried either
before 8Th August 2010 14:13:13 UT, or between 10Th August 2010 14:15:16
and 8Th November 2010 11:12:13 UT, with airmass >= 2.0 and hour angle
within [-2,2] hours corresponding to [-30,30] degrees (e.g. four hours around object transit
time). The object will be also observed for 10 times. If the object was
already observed 10 times, it will not be observed again.

                <interval>
                        <from>2010-08-10T14:15:16</from>
                        <to>2010-11-08T11:12:13</to>
                </interval>
        </time>
        <airmass>
                <interval>
                        <upper>2.0</upper>
                </interval>
        </airmass>
        <HA>
                <interval>
                        <lower>-30</lower>
                        <upper>30</upper>
                </interval>
        </HA>
	<maxRepeats>10</maxRepeats>
</constraints>
----

Intervals always use or logic - e.g. if interval for airmass is specified as:

----
<airmass>
	<interval>
		<upper>2.0</upper>
	</interval>
	<interval>
		<lower>2.5</lower>
		<upper>3.0</upper>
	</interval>
</airmass>
----

the object airmass should be either lower then 2.0, or between 2.5 and
3.0. Object observing constraints will be violated if the object airmass
is between 2.5 and 2.0, or lower then 3.0. The use of the _on logic_ is also demonstrated in time interval above.

The variables are always connected with and logic - e.g. the objects and
system values must all be satisfied for object constraints to be
satisfied.

* **time** Specifies time intervals when the observations should be done. The
  intervals are specified in XML time format - e.g. as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sss. Please see above for an example.

* **airmass** Allowed airmass. Airmass 1.0 is at zenith, and its value increases
  towards horizon.

* **zenithDistance** Zenith distance boundaries. Zenith distance is 0 at zenith, 90&deg; at horizon and
  is equal to 90.0 - object altitude.

* **HA** Allowed hour angle in units of degrees [0, +/-180]. Hour angle 0 is
  at local meridian (e.g. when the object is at the highest
  altitude), and is 180 (or -180) 12 hours after that.

* **dec** Allowed declination in units of degrees [0, +/-90].

* **altitude** Allowed altitude of the object.

* **azimuth** Allowed azimuth of the object.

* **lunarDistance** Angular distance between object and moon center.

* **lunarAltitude** Altitude of the moon at observe location.

* **lunarPhase** Lunar phase, specified in degrees. 0 to 100, 0 is new moon, 50 is
  full moon.

* **solarDistance** Angular distance between object and sun center.

* **solarAltitude** Sun altitude (angular distance from the horizon) at observe location.

* **maxRepeats** Maximum number of observations. The target will not be selected if
  it has already given number of observations performed.
